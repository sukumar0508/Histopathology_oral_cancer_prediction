# Histopathology_oral_cancer_prediction
This repository contains code and resources for oral cancer prediction using deep learning techniques on histopathology image datasets. The project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models (e.g., AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet101, DenseNet169, HRNet-W18) to identify normal mucosa and oral cancer categories.
